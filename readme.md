# HangmanJS

A hangman game made with Vanilla JavaScript

## @params

* Press any key to get started!
* Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
* If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
* As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.
* Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
* Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
* After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

### Bonus
* Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
* Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
* HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
* Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
* Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
* Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.
